Unit Testing
Agile Development
Test-Driven Development
	Create or Change Code
	Create a Repeatable Test
	Review the Results

Unit Test
	The goal is 100% coverage
	Tests can be run from within Visual Studio for developer productivity
	Unit tests can be automated as part of a continuous integration process using a product like Jenkins, TeamCity, or Team Foundation Server

	
Create a Project in Visual Studio and name it 'Essential Training'

Array
	A way to store more than one value in a variable at one time
	Have a fixed size, want to instantiate the size
	Ex:
		var groceryList = new string[4];

	More Array
		Can create an array all at once by doing
		var secondgroceryList = new string[4] { "Milk", "Eggs", "Cheese", "Apples"};

	Another way of creating an Array as an instance variable
		public string[] GroceryList;

Check file SimpleArray to see how a property of an array is created


Multi-Dimensional Arrays
	Arrays that contain Arrays
	var multi = new int[3, 4]
	{
		{0,1,2,3},
		{4,5,6,7},
		{8,9,10,11}
	};

	To call on a specific position you do what is similar with a single-dimensional array
		multi[2, 3]

		Keep in mind; this is calling upon technically speaking, the third row in the array. So the
		output would be 11

		
LINQ
	Set of extension classes that hook onto pretty much any kind of collection, and they allow us to do some really interesting things with our collections.
