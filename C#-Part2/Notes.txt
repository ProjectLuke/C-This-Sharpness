Array
	A way to store more than one value in a variable at one time
	Have a fixed size, want to instantiate the size
	Ex:
		var groceryList = new string[4];

	More Array
		Can create an array all at once by doing
		var secondgroceryList = new string[4] { "Milk", "Eggs", "Cheese", "Apples"};

	Another way of creating an Array as an instance variable
		public string[] GroceryList;

Check file SimpleArray to see how a property of an array is created
